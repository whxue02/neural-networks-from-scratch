THEORY (from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqOfi41LfDw)
 - simple example
    - predict a drugs effectiveness based on dose
    - low and high are ineffective (0), but medium is (1)
    - on a graph, no straight line will give us a good prediction of whether
        a new dosage would be effectiveness
    - neural networks can fit a squiggle to the data
        - were gonna use this example to show how nn fits the squiggle
 -  what is a neural network?
    - consists of nodes
        - inside of nodes in pic, the lines are the building bocks for fitting
            the squiggle 
            - represents softplus, ReLU, sigmoid, or other lines
            - also known as activation functions
    - and connections between the nodes
        - the numbers along each connection represent parameter values that 
            were estimated when the nn was fit to the data
        - for the simple example, the parameter estimates are basically slope 
            and intercept we solve for when fitting a straight line to data
        - parameter values start unknown, but estimated with backpropagation
    - example in video has one input node, one output node, and 1 hidden layer
        with 2 nodes in the layer
 - how do we create a squiggle from the activation functions?
    - assume that dosages go from low (0) to high (1)
    - assume parameters are already found
    - first, plug lowest dosage (0) into the nn
        - to get from input node to top node, use the parameters to get x coord
            - (dosage * 34.3) + 2.14 = x-axis coordinate for activation function
            - get y-coord by plugging x-coord into the activation function
            - from this you get a curve
            - then, scale the curve by -1.3
            - new curve!
        - do the same for the bottom node with it's parameters
        - now, add the curves together, and then subtract 0.58
        - this forms the squiggle!
            - if you want to make a prediction, use the value as the input,
                and do the math again to get the efficacy (output)
 - terminology
    - the parameters that are multiplied are weights
    - the parameters that are added are biases
